Nagata Sensei Site Repository
- Classes content will be available here.

I've decided to upload some of my classes materials, to use in many different courses that I teach at SENAI.

So here my students will be able to access all content here, such as presentations that I use at the classes, and also files, forms and many other media content.

I hope that they improve their learning experience through the course as I improve my skills as a web developer.

There are a few things to polish here and there, but it will be awesome when it's done.
